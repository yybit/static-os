### Prepare

Before building image, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) need to be installed.
If you cross-compile the imageï¼ŒRun this to support multiple platform. `DOCKER_CLI=nerdctl ${DOCKER_CLI} run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all``

### Build disk image

```shell
# Use `docker` cli by default
make img
# Use a docker-compatible cli
make img DOCKER_CLI='lima sudo nerdctl'
```

### Run disk image with qemu
